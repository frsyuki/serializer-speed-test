====================
http://github.com/frsyuki/serializer-speed-test


## Overview
Performance benchmark tool of serialization libraries written in C++.


## Libraries


### [MessagePack] (http://msgpack.sourceforge.net/)
MessagePack is an extremely efficient object serialization library. It's like JSON, but very fast and small.


### [Protocol Buffers] (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/)
Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format. Google uses Protocol Buffers for almost all of its internal RPC protocols and file formats.


### [YAJL] (http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/)
Yet Another JSON Library. YAJL is a small event-driven (SAX-style) JSON parser written in ANSI C, and a small validating JSON generator.
